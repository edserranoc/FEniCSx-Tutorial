# FEniCSx Learning & Exploration

This repository documents my journey in learning FEniCSx â€” the next-generation open-source computing platform for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using the finite element method (FEM).

The repository will include:

- Code examples for different PDE problems
- Mini-projects to practice solving real-world PDEs
- Experiments with custom meshes, boundary conditions, and solvers.

## ðŸ“… Learning Plan
