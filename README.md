# FEniCSx Learning & Exploration

This repository documents my journey in learning FEniCSx â€” the next-generation open-source computing platform for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using the finite element method (FEM).

The repository will include:

- Code examples for different PDE problems
- Mini-projects to practice solving real-world PDEs
- Experiments with custom meshes, boundary conditions, and solvers.

## ðŸ“… Learning Plan

### Phase 1 - Foundations

**Goal:** Get familiar with FEniCSx basics and the Python API.

- [x] Install FEniCSx, mshr, Paraview
- [ ] Poisson Equation (Basic Example - Complex Example)

**Comments:** The easiest way to install FEniCSx in a virtual environment is through Anaconda. ParaView offers high-quality images for PDE visualization.
